# Welcome to my profile!
Hello, I`m Pedro Muller Legnaghi and I am currently pursuing my studies at Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). With a strong passion for software development, I am actively honing my skills in JavaScript, as well as applying my knowledge of HTML and CSS to build responsive and well-structured web applications. Through continuous learning and hands-on experience, I strive to create solid and scalable solutions while staying up to date with the latest trends in the field. 

Feel free to explore my repositories as I continue to grow as a developer!
